Contributing to this repo
=========================

We follow standard GitHub contributing methods, which are summarized below, but also more in-depth [here](https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles):
1. Fork a copy to your own repo.
2. Clone your forked copy
3. Create a new branch to work on the patch
4. When you're done, commit and push the new branch
5. Go to the Pull Requests page, and create a new Pull Request
6. If you are fixing an issue, reference the issue # in your PR.
7. Travis will run a build with your changes, and make sure everything still builds fine
8. A member of the team will review your changes, and either merge them or give you reasons why they didn't
9. If you commit more than once in the PR, make sure to squash your commits

###A couple of other points:

* Make sure to write tests if you added any functionality (if you need help with the tests, push your changes to your forked copy and ask for help on IRC)
* Please keep with existing coding style
* Leave comments where needed

Also, thanks for contributing. You guys are awesome for helping us out.
